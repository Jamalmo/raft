#summary Installation of RAFT on various platforms.

= Installation =

RAFT is written in Python and PyQT. This is done so that the application can be multiplatform. RAFT is a Python 2.x application, Python 3.x is not supported at this time. 

You must use a version of Python that is greater than 2.6.5. Other versions may work, but are untested.

=== Dependencies === 


== <font color="blue">OSX</font> ==
*Note* We still do not have an installable binary available for Mac OSX. It will be necessary to download the source and use your installed environment. 

Versions of OSX that are supported are 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and 10.7 (Lion). Other versions should work, but are just untested.

== <font color="blue">Linux</font> ==

== <font color="blue">Windows</font> ==

*Note* We still do not have a self contained executable for Windows. It will be necessary to download the source and use your installed environment.

=== Getting Python ===
You can choose to go two ways when installing Python on Windows. You can choose the standard Python distribution from http://python.org or you can use {{{ActivePython}}} from {{{ActiveState}}} http://www.activestate.com/activepython

Ensure that you set whatever version of python you install to the default version for the system for ease of use.

=== Getting PyQT ===
Download the appropriate binary package of PyQT for your installed Python version from the following location.
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

Binary packages for Windows include QScintilla which is a dependency for RAFT. This inclusion makes life easier.

=== Getting lxml ===

The lxml binary can be obtained most easily by using one of two methods, but using Python's easy_install command or by using ActivePython's PyPM command if using an ActivePython install.
<code>
easy_install lxml
</code>
<code>
pypm install lxml
</code>
*Note* If you are on a 64bit Windows system PyPM requires that you have a valid business license to install lxml.

=== Now Go ===

After installing the previous items you should be able to run RAFT from the project directory by using the following command.

<code>
python raft.pyw
</code>
